Use it
------

Go to your email service provider like mandrillapp.com and find where to configure your webhook.
Check hooks you want and set the url like this:

http://www.mywebsite.com/webhook/{secretSalt}/{serviceName}/catch

With no configuration for mandrill it should be :
http://www.mywebsite.com/webhook/notSecret/mandrill/catch

With a custom secretSalt and mailjet service it should be :
http://www.mywebsite.com/webhook/dDifXo26/mailjet/catch


Events dispatched
-----------------

- swm.mail_hook.event.open
- swm.mail_hook.event.send
- swm.mail_hook.event.click
- swm.mail_hook.event.soft_bounce
- swm.mail_hook.event.hard_bounce
- swm.mail_hook.event.deferral
- swm.mail_hook.event.spam
- swm.mail_hook.event.blocked
- swm.mail_hook.event.unsub
- swm.mail_hook.event.reject
- swm.mail_hook.event.other


Events listener provided
------------------------

By default, a simple MailHookEvent is dispatched by the DefaultHydrator.
But if you are using FosUserBundle, you can use the FosUserHydrator to use directly UserMailHookEvent which return directly the user entity associate on the email.


If your using FosUserBundle
----------------------------

There's already a special route called "swm_mailhook_user_catcher_for_service":
/{secretSalt}/{service}/catchuser

It directly return a UserMailHookEvent where you can getUser().
